WiseCapturer
============

If you're looking to create a tool like Gyazo, which captures a selected area and uploads, or a Gif capturer tool like GyazoGif, you're looking at the right repository.

WiseCapturer gives you a full control of selecting an area, capturing a gif, and a screenshot, and simply get the captured file with a few of line calls.
